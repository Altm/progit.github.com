Pro Git Book
==================

This is the Jekyll source for the Pro Git book website, the online 
edition of the Pro Git Book published by Apress.

The design is based on the awesome Michael Bleigh's blog and website, [Mister Bleigh](http://www.mbleigh.com/), and he gets full credit for everything that is good looking or impressive about this site.

It makes some nice use of Jekyll's liquid templating system (see blog.html) and uses Javscript to pull information from GitHub for the open-source section.
