title: Kindle and iBook Versions Available
---

When Pro Git was first released, I asked about being able to get it on my Kindle.
In fact, one of the very first people to read the book was @adelcambre with a 
mobi file I generated myself.  It was horrible looking, but it did work. My
editor at Apress wanted to do it, but wasn't sure if it was going to get done.

Well, I just randomly found out that it did in fact finally get done.  
About 9 months after it was first published, I saw on my Amazon referal account
that I had sold a Kindle version, which confused me.  However, I went to Amazon
and there it was:

So, if you feel like reading it on the Kindle, have at it.  There have also been
a number of people who have asked me how they can support the book without 
getting a dead-tree version, so here's your chance.  You can even get a Kindle
reader for your computer, so you can search through it and whatnot.
