## Getting Help ##

If you ever need help while using Git, there are three ways to get the manpage help for any of the Git commands.

	$ git help <verb>
	$ git <verb> --help
	$ man git-<verb>

So, for example, you can get the manpage help for the 'config' command by running 

	$ git help config
	
These commands are nice because you can access them anywhere, even offline.  

If those manual pages and this book are not enough and you need in-person help, you can try the `#git` or `#github` channels on the Freenode IRC server (irc.freenode.net).  They are regularly filled with hundreds of people who are all very knowledgable about Git and often very willing to help.
