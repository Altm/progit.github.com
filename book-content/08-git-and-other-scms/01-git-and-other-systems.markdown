# Git and Other Systems #

The world is not perfect.  Many of us cannot simply switch every project you come in contact with to Git immediately.  Sometimes you will be stuck on a project using another version control system and many times that system will be Subversion.  The first part of this Chapter will be spent learning about `git svn`, Gits bidirectional Subversion gateway tool.

Then at some point you may want to convert your existing project to Git, so the second part of this chapter will cover how to migrate your project into Git, both from Subversion and then from Perforce, a proprietary SCM system.




sop: Should we cover git cvsimport/cvsexport?  git p4?  These tools are in use by many folks too, but aren't nearly as popular as SVN.   {: class=note}

dwp: You can't cover everything, and svn is clearly the main one. Might be worth pointing to how to do these others though, even if you don't explain it in the book. {: class=note}
