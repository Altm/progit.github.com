title: Pro Git 5.23 Distributed Git Generating a Build Number

<h2 id='generating_a_build_number'>Generating a Build Number</h2>

<p>Because Git doesn’t have monotonically increasing numbers like ‘v123’ or the equivalent to go with each commit, if you want to have a human-readable name to go with a commit, you can run git describe on that commit. Git gives you the name of the nearest tag with the number of commits on top of that tag and a partial SHA-1 value of the commit you’re describing:</p>

<pre><code>$ git describe master
v1.6.2-rc1-20-g8c5b85c</code></pre>

<p>This way, you can export a snapshot or build and name it something understandable to people. In fact, if you build Git from source code cloned from the Git repository, git &#8211;version gives you something that looks like this. If you’re describing a commit that you have directly tagged, it gives you the tag name.</p>

<p>The git describe command favors annotated tags (tags created with the -a or -s flag), so release tags should be created this way if you’re using git describe, to ensure the commit is named properly when described. You can also use this string as the target of a checkout or show command, although it relies on the abbreviated SHA-1 value at the end, so it may not be valid forever. For instance, the Linux kernel recently jumped from 8 to 10 characters to ensure SHA-1 object uniqueness, so older git describe output names were invalidated.</p>
