<h1>Chapter 9</h1><h1 id='git_internals'>Git Internals</h1>

<p>You may have skipped to this chapter from a previous chapter or you may have gotten here after reading the rest of the book - in either case, this is where we will go over the inner workings and implementation of Git. I found learning this information as being fundamentally important to really understanding how useful and powerful Git is, but others have argued to me that it can be confusing and unneccesarily complex for beginners. Thus, I have placed it as the last chapter in this book so that you can read it early or later in your learning process. I leave it up to you to decide.</p>

<p>Now that you are here however, let&#8217;s get started. First of all, if it is not yet clear, Git is fundamentally a content addressable filesystem which then had a version control system user interface written on top of it. We&#8217;ll cover what this means in depth in a bit.</p>

<p>In the early days of Git (mostly pre 1.5), the user interface was much more complex because it emphasized more of this filesystem rather than a polished VCS. In the last few years the UI has become polished and refined to be as clean and easy to use as any other system out there, but often the stereotype of the Git UI in it&#8217;s early days being difficult to learn and complex still propogates.</p>

<p>However, this content addressable filesystem layer is pretty amazingly cool as well, so we&#8217;ll cover that first in this chapter, then we&#8217;ll cover the transport mechanisms and lastly the repository maintainance tasks that you may eventually have to deal with.</p>
