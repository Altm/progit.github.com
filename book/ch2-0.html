<h1>Chapter 2</h1><h1 id='git_basics'>Git Basics</h1>

<p>If you can only read one chapter to get going with Git, this is it. This chapter will cover every basic command you need to know to do the vast majority of the things you will eventually spend your time doing with Git. By the end of it, you should be able to configure and initialize a repository, begin and stop tracking files, and to stage and commit changes. We will also show you how to setup Git to ignore certain files and file patterns, how to undo mistakes quickly and easily, how to browse the history of your project and view changes between commits properly and how to push and pull from remote repositories easily.</p>
