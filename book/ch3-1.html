title: Pro Git 3.1 Git Branching What a Branch Is

<h2 id='what_a_branch_is'>What a Branch Is</h2>

<p>To really understand the way Git does branching, we need to take a step back and examine how Git stores its data. As you may remember from Chapter 1, Git does not store its data as a series of changesets or deltas, but instead as a series of snapshots.</p>

<p>When you commit in Git, it stores a commit object, which contains a pointer to the snapshot of the content you had staged, the author and message metadata, and zero or more pointers to the commit or commits that were the direct parents of this commit. Zero parents for the first commit, one for normal commits, and multiple parents for commits that result from a merge of two or more branches.</p>

<p>To visualize this, let’s assume that we have a directory with three files in it and we stage them all and commit. Staging them is going to checksum each of the files (the SHA-1 hash we mentioned in Chapter 1), store that version of the file in the Git repository (Git refers to them as ‘blobs’) and add that checksum to the staging area.</p>

<pre><code>$ git add README test.rb LICENSE2
$ git commit -m &#39;initial commit of my project&#39;</code></pre>

<p>When you create the commit but running &#8216;git commit&#8217;, it will checksum each subdirectory (in this case, just the root project directory) and store those ‘tree’ objects in the Git repository. It then creates a commit object that has the metadata and a pointer to the root project tree so it can recreate that snapshot when needed.</p>

<p>There are now five objects in your Git repository – one ‘blob’ for the contents of each of your files, one ‘tree’ that lists the contents of the directory and specifies which file names are stored as which blobs, and one commit with the pointer to that root tree and all the commit metadata. Conceptually, the data in your Git repository looks something like Figure 3.1.</p>

<p>If you make some changes and commit again, the next commit will store a pointer to the commit that came immediately before it. So after two more commits, our history might look something like Figure 3.2.</p>

<p><img src='/images/branch1.png' alt='Figure 3.2' /></p>

<p>Now, a &#8216;branch&#8217; in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is called &#8216;master&#8217;. As you initially make commits, you will be given a &#8216;master&#8217; branch which will just point to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, it will move forward automatically.</p>

<p><img src='/images/branch3.png' alt='Figure 3.3' /></p>

<p>Now, what happens if we create a new branch? Well, it just creates a new pointer for us to move around. Let&#8217;s say we create a new branch called &#8216;testing&#8217;. We do this with the &#8216;git branch&#8217; command:</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch testing</code></pre>

<p>This will create a new pointer at the same commit we are currently on.</p>

<p><img src='/images/branch4.png' alt='Figure 3.4' /></p>

<p>So, how does Git know what branch we are currently &#8216;on&#8217;? There is a special pointer it keeps called &#8216;HEAD&#8217;. Note that this is a lot different than the concept of HEAD in other version control systems that you might be used to such as Subversion or CVS. In Git, this is a pointer to the local branch we are currently on. In this case we are still on &#8216;master&#8217;. The &#8216;git branch&#8217; command only created a new branch, it did not switch to it.</p>

<p><img src='/images/branch5.png' alt='Figure 3.5' /></p>

<p>To switch to one of our existing branches, we run the &#8216;git checkout&#8217; command. So, let&#8217;s switch to our new &#8216;testing&#8217; branch.</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout testing</code></pre>

<p>This will simply move our HEAD to point to the &#8216;testing&#8217; branch.</p>

<p><img src='/images/branch6.png' alt='Figure 3.6' /></p>

<p>So what is the significance of that? Well, let&#8217;s do another commit.</p>

<pre><code>$ vim test.rb
$ git commit -a -m &#39;made a change&#39;</code></pre>

<p><img src='/images/branch7.png' alt='Figure 3.7' /></p>

<p>This is interesting, because now our &#8216;testing&#8217; branch has moved forward, but our &#8216;master&#8217; branch still points to the commit we were on when we did our &#8216;git checkout&#8217; to switch branches. So, let&#8217;s switch back to our &#8216;master&#8217; branch.</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout master</code></pre>

<p><img src='/images/branch8.png' alt='Figure 3.8' /></p>

<p>That command actually did two things. It moved the HEAD pointer back to point to the &#8216;master&#8217; branch, and it reverted the files in our working directory back to the snapshot that &#8216;master&#8217; points to. This also means that the changes we make from this point forward will diverge from an older version of the project. It essentially rewinds the work we&#8217;ve done in our &#8216;testing&#8217; branch temporarily so we can go in a different direction.</p>

<p>So, let&#8217;s make a few changes and commit again.</p>

<pre><code>$ vim test.rb
$ git commit -a -m &#39;made other changes&#39;</code></pre>

<p>Now our project history has diverged. We created and switched to a branch, did some work on it, then switched back to our main branch and did seperate work. Now both of those changes are isolated in &#8216;branches&#8217; that we can switch back and forth between and then merge together when we are ready to. All just with simple branch and checkout commands.</p>
