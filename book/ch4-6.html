title: Pro Git 4.6 Git on the Server Summary
---
<h2 id='summary'>Summary</h2>

<p>There are several options to get a remote Git repository up and running so that you can collaborate with others or share your work.</p>

<p>Running your own server gives you a lot of control and allows you to run the server within your own firewall, but it is generally pretty difficult and possibly expensive to setup and maintain.</p>

<p>dwp: I don&#8217;t think you should say it&#8217;s difficult and expensive to maintain a git server! (Though I agree with you that the easiest way is to use a hosted one&#8230;) It&#8217;s certainly more hassle to roll your own.</p>

<p>Running a server on AWS can be a quick way to get started, but it&#8217;s also a bit expensive to keep running all the time and you&#8217;ll have to back it up or move the data to Amazon block storage, or else any time the server goes down you&#8217;ll lose your whole setup.</p>

<p>Finally, putting your data on a hosted server is easy to setup and cheap to maintain, even for private data, however you have to be able to keep your code on someone else&#8217;s servers, and some organizations do not allow that.</p>

<p>dwp: It also gives you an off-site backup, of course.</p>

<p>Hopefully it should be fairly straightforward which solution or combination of solutions is appropriate for you and your organization.</p><div id='nav'>
