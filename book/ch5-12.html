<h2 id='merging_workflows'>Merging Workflows</h2>

<p>One simple workflow merges your work into your master branch. In this scenario, you have a master branch that contains basically stable code. When you have work in a topic branch that you’ve done or that someone has contributed and you’ve verified, you merge it into your master branch, delete the topic branch, and then continue the process. If we have a repository with work in two branches named <code>ruby_client</code> and <code>php_client</code> that looks like Figure 5-19 and merge <code>ruby_client</code> first and then <code>php_client</code> next, then your history will end up looking like Figure 5-20.</p>

<p>That is probably the simplest workflow, but it’s problematic if you’re dealing with larger repositories or projects.</p>

<p>If you have more developers or a larger project, you’ll probably want to use at least a two-phase merge cycle. In this scenario, you have two long-running branches, master and develop, in which you determine that master is updated only when a very stable release is cut and all new code is integrated into the develop branch. You regularly push both of these branches to the public repository. Each time you have a new topic branch to merge in (Figure 5-21), you merge it into develop (Figure 5-22); then, when you tag a release, you fast-forward master to wherever the now-stable develop branch is (Figure 5-23).</p>

<p>This way, when people clone your project’s repository, they can either check out master to build the latest stable version and keep up to date on that easily, or they can check out develop, which is the more cutting-edge stuff. You can also continue this concept, having an integrate branch where all the work is merged together. Then, when the codebase on that branch is stable and passes tests, you merge it into a develop branch; and when that has proven itself stable for a while, you fast-forward your master branch.</p>
