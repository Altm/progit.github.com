title: Pro Git 9.9 Git Internals The Refspec
---
<h2 id='the_refspec'>The Refspec</h2>

<p>Throughout this book we are using pretty simple mappings from remote branches to local references, but they can be more complex.</p>

<p>When you add a remote like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote add origin git@github.com:schacon/simplegit-progit.git</code></pre>

<p>Basically what that will do is add a section to your <code>.git/config</code> file specifying the name of the remote (&#8216;origin&#8217;), the url of the remote repository and the <em>refspec</em> for fetching.</p>

<pre><code>[remote &quot;origin&quot;]
	url = git@github.com:schacon/simplegit-progit.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*</code></pre>

<p>The format of the refspec is an optional &#8217;+&#8217;, followed by <code>&lt;src&gt;:&lt;dst&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;src&gt;</code> is the pattern for references on the remote side and <code>&lt;dst&gt;</code> is where those references are going to be written locally. The &#8217;+&#8217; tells Git to update the reference even if it is not a fast-forward.</p>

<p>In the default case that is automatically written by a <code>git remote add</code> command, we can see that Git will fetch all of the references under &#8216;refs/heads/&#8217; on the server and write them to &#8216;refs/remotes/origin/&#8217; locally. So if there is a &#8216;master&#8217; branch on the server, you will be able to access the log of that branch locally via:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log origin/master
$ git log remotes/origin/master
$ git log refs/remotes/origin/master</code></pre>

<p>They are all equivalent, since Git will expand each of them out to &#8216;refs/remotes/origin/master&#8217;.</p>

<p>If you wanted Git instead to only pull down the master branch each time and not every other branch on the remote server, you can change the &#8216;fetch&#8217; line to:</p>

<pre><code>fetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master</code></pre>

<p>Now this is just the default refspec for <code>git fetch</code> for that remote. If you want to do something one time, you can specify the refspec on the command line too. If you wanted to pull the &#8216;master&#8217; branch on the remote down to &#8216;origin/mymaster&#8217; locally, you can run:</p>

<pre><code>$ git fetch origin master:refs/remotes/origin/mymaster</code></pre>

<p>You can also specify multiple refspecs. On the command line, you can pull down several branches like so:</p>

<pre><code>$ git fetch origin master:refs/remotes/origin/mymaster topic:refs/remotes/origin/topic
From git@github.com:schacon/simplegit
 ! [rejected]        master     -&gt; origin/mymaster  (non fast forward)
 * [new branch]      topic      -&gt; origin/topic</code></pre>

<p>In this case, our &#8216;master&#8217; branch pull got rejected because it wasn&#8217;t a fast forward reference. You can override that by specifying the &#8217;+&#8217; in front of the refspec.</p>

<p>You can also specify multiple refspecs for fetching in your configuration file. If you wanted to always fetch the &#8216;master&#8217; and &#8216;experiment&#8217; branches, you can simply add two lines:</p>

<pre><code>[remote &quot;origin&quot;]
	url = git@github.com:schacon/simplegit-progit.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master
	fetch = +refs/heads/experiment:refs/remotes/origin/experiment</code></pre>

<p>You cannot use partial globs in the pattern, so this would be invalid:</p>

<pre><code>fetch = +refs/heads/qa*:refs/remotes/origin/qa*</code></pre>

<p>However, you can use namespacing to accomplish something like that. If you had a QA team that pushed a series of branches and you wanted to get the master branch and any of the QA teams branches but nothing else, you can use a config section like this:</p>

<pre><code>[remote &quot;origin&quot;]
	url = git@github.com:schacon/simplegit-progit.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master
	fetch = +refs/heads/qa/*:refs/remotes/origin/qa/*</code></pre>

<p>So if you have a complex workflow process that has a QA team pushing branches, developers pushing branches and integration teams pushing and collaborating on remote branches, you can namespace them pretty easily this way.</p>

<h3 id='pushing_refspec'>Pushing Refspec</h3>

<p>It is nice that you can fetch namespaced references that way, but how does the QA team get their branches into a &#8216;qa/&#8217; namespace in the first place? You accomplish that by using refspecs to push.</p>

<p>If the QA team wants to push their master branch to &#8216;qa/master&#8217; on the remote server, they can run:</p>

<pre><code>$ git push origin master:refs/heads/qa/master</code></pre>

<p>If they want Git to do that automatically each time they run <code>git push origin</code>, they can add a &#8216;push&#8217; value to their config file:</p>

<pre><code>[remote &quot;origin&quot;]
	url = git@github.com:schacon/simplegit-progit.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
	push = refs/heads/master:refs/heads/qa/master</code></pre>

<p>DWP: May as well explain it. This means that a push from the local &#8216;master&#8217; branch will go to the remote &#8216;qa/master&#8217; branch.</p>

<h3 id='deleting_references'>Deleting References</h3>

<p>You can also use the refspec to delete references from the remote server by running something like:</p>

<pre><code>$ git push origin :topic</code></pre>

<p>Since the refspec is <code>&lt;src&gt;:&lt;dst&gt;</code>, this is basically saying &#8216;make the topic branch on the remote <em>nothing</em>&#8217;, which deletes it.</p>
