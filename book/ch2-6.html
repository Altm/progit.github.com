<h2 id='option_description'>Option Description</h2>

<p><code>-p</code> Show the patch introduced with each commit.</p>

<p><code>--stat</code> Show statistics for files modified in each commit.</p>

<p><code>--shortstat</code> Display only the changed/insertions/deletions line from the <code>--stat</code> command.</p>

<p><code>--name-only</code> Show the list of files modified after the commit information.</p>

<p><code>--name-status</code> Show the list of files affected with added/modified/deleted information as well.</p>

<p><code>--abbrev-commit</code> Show only the first few characters of the SHA-1 checksum instead of all 40.</p>

<p><code>--relative-date</code> Display the date in a relative format (for example, “2 weeks ago”) instead of using the full date format.</p>

<p><code>--graph</code> Display an ASCII graph of the branch and merge history beside the log output.</p>

<p><code>--pretty</code> Show commits in an alternate format. Options include oneline, short, full, fuller, and format (where you specify</p>

<pre><code>              your own format).</code></pre>

<p>Table: Some <code>git log</code> options</p>

<h3 id='limiting_log_output'>Limiting Log Output</h3>

<p>In addition to output-formatting options, git log takes a number of useful limiting options — that is, options that let you show only a subset of commits. You’ve seen one such option already — the <code>-2</code> option, which show only the last two commits. In fact, you can do <code>-&lt;n&gt;</code>, where <code>n</code> is any integer to show the last <code>n</code> commits. In reality, you’re unlikely to use that often, because Git by default pipes all output through a pager so you see only one page of log output at a time.</p>

<p>However, the time-limiting options such as <code>--since</code> and <code>--until</code> are very useful. For example, this command gets the list of commits made in the last two weeks:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --since=2.weeks</code></pre>

<p>This command works with lots of formats — you can specify a specific date (“2008-01-15”) or a relative date such as “2 years 1 day 3 minutes ago”.</p>

<p>You can also filter the list to commits that match some search criteria. The <code>--author</code> option allows you to filter on a specific author, and the <code>--grep</code> option lets you search for keywords in the commit messages. (Note that if you want to specify both author and grep options, you have to add <code>--all-match</code> or the command will match commits with either.)</p>

<p>The last really useful option to pass to <code>git log</code> as a filter is a path. If you specify a directory or file name, you can limit the log output to commits that introduced a change to those files. This is always the last option and is generally preceded by double dashes (<code>--</code>) to separate the paths from the options.</p>

<p>In Table 2-3 we’ll list these and a few other common options for your reference.</p>
