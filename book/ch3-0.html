<h1>Chapter 3</h1><h1 id='git_branching'>Git Branching</h1>

<p>Nearly every version control system out there has some form of branching support. Branching is where you can diverge from the main line of development without messing with that main line. In many VCS tools, this is a somewhat expensive process, often requiring you to create an entirely new copy of your source code directory, which can take quite a long time for large projects.</p>

<p>Some people have referred to the branching model in Git as its “killer feature” and it certainly sets it apart in the VCS community. Why is it so special? The way Git branches is incredibly lightweight, making branching operations nearly instant and switching back and forth between them generally just as fast. Unlike many other VCSs, Git encourages a workflow that branches and merges quite often, even multiple times every day. Understanding and mastering this feature gives you a very powerful and unique tool and can quite literally change the way that you develop.</p>
