<p>Table: Format options</p>

<p>You may be wondering what the difference is between <em>author</em> and <em>committer</em>. The author is the person who originally wrote the work, whereas the committer is the person who last applied the work. So, if you send in a patch to a project and one of the core members applies the patch, both of you get credit — you as the author and the core member as the committer. We’ll cover this distinction a bit more in Chapter 5.</p>

<p>The oneline and format options are particularly useful with another <code>log</code> option called <code>--graph</code>. This option adds a nice little ASCII graph showing your branch and merge history, which we can see our copy of the Grit project repository:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --pretty=format:&quot;%h %s&quot; --graph
* 2d3acf9 ignore errors from SIGCHLD on trap
*  5e3ee11 Merge branch &#39;master&#39; of git://github.com/dustin/grit
|\
| * 420eac9 Added a method for getting the current branch.
* | 30e367c timeout code and tests
* | 5a09431 add timeout protection to grit
* | e1193f8 support for heads with slashes in them
|/
* d6016bc require time for xmlschema
*  11d191e Merge branch &#39;defunkt&#39; into local</code></pre>

<p>Those are only some simple output-formatting options to <code>git log</code> — there are many more. Table 2-2 lists the options we’ve covered so far and some other common formatting options that may be useful, along with how they change the output of the log command.</p>
