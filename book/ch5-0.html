<h1>Chapter 5</h1><h1 id='distributed_git'>Distributed Git</h1>

<p>Now that we have a remote Git repository setup as a point for all the developers to share their code, and we&#8217;re familiar with basic Git commands in a local workflow, lets look at how to utilize some of the distributed workflows that Git affords us.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we will see how to work with Git in a distributed environment as a contributor and an integrator. That is, how to contribute code successfully to a project and make it as easy on you and the project maintainer as possible, and also how to maintain a project successfully with a number of developers contributing.</p>
