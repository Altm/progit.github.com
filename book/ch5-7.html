title: Pro Git 5.7 Distributed Git Applying Patches from E-mail
---
<h2 id='applying_patches_from_email'>Applying Patches from E-mail</h2>

<p>If you receive a patch over e-mail that you need to integrate into your project, you need to apply the patch in your topic branch to evaluate it. There are two ways to apply an e-mailed patch: with git apply or with git am.</p>

<h3 id='applying_a_patch_with_apply'>Applying a Patch with apply</h3>

<p>If you received the patch from someone who generated it with the git diff or a Unix diff command, you can apply it with the git apply command. Assuming you saved the patch at /tmp/patch-ruby-client.patch, you can apply the patch like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ git apply /tmp/patch-ruby-client.patch</code></pre>

<p>This modifies the files in your working directory. It’s almost identical to running a <code>patch -p1</code> command to apply the patch, although it’s more paranoid and accepts fewer fuzzy matches then patch. It also handles file adds, deletes, and renames if they’re described in the git diff format, which patch won’t do. Finally, git apply is an “apply all or abort all” model where either everything is applied or nothing is, whereas patch can partially apply patchfiles, leaving your working directory in a weird state. git apply is over all much more paranoid than patch. It won’t create a commit for you—after running it, you must stage and commit the changes introduced manually.</p>

<p>You can also use git apply to see if a patch applies cleanly before you try actually applying it—you can run git apply &#8211;check with the patch:</p>

<pre><code>$ git apply --check 0001-seeing-if-this-helps-the-gem.patch 
error: patch failed: ticgit.gemspec:1
error: ticgit.gemspec: patch does not apply</code></pre>

<p>If there is no output, then the patch should apply cleanly. This command also exits with a non-zero status if the check fails, so you can use it in scripts if you want.</p>
