title: Pro Git 5.9 Distributed Git Checking Out Remote Branches
---
<h2 id='checking_out_remote_branches'>Checking Out Remote Branches</h2>

<p>If your contribution came from a Git user who set up their own repository, pushed a number of changes into it, and then sent you the URL to the repository and the name of the remote branch the changes are in, you can add them as a remote and do merges locally.</p>

<p>For instance, if Jessica sends you an e-mail saying that she has a great new feature in the ruby-client branch of her repository, you can test it by adding the remote and checking out that branch locally:</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote add jessica git://github.com/jessica/myproject.git
$ git fetch jessica
$ git checkout -b rubyclient jessica/ruby-client</code></pre>

<p>If she e-mails you again later with another branch containing another great feature, you can fetch and check out because you already have the remote setup.</p>

<p>This is most useful if you’re working with a person consistently. If someone only has a single patch to contribute once in a while, then accepting it over e-mail may be less time consuming than requiring everyone to run their own server and having to continually add and remove remotes to get a few patches. You’re also unlikely to want to have hundreds of remotes, each for someone who contributes only a patch or two. However, scripts and hosted services may make this easier—it depends largely on how you develop and how your contributors develop.</p>

<p>The other advantage of this approach is that you get the history of the commits as well. Although you may have legitimate merge issues, you know where in your history their work is based; a proper three-way merge is the default rather than having to supply a -3 and hope the patch was generated off a public commit to which you have access.</p>

<p>If you aren’t working with a person consistently but still want to pull from them in this way, you can provide the URL of the remote repository to the git pull command. This does a one-time pull and doesn’t save the URL as a remote reference:</p>

<pre><code>$ git pull git://github.com/onetimeguy/project.git
From git://github.com/onetimeguy/project
 * branch            HEAD       -&gt; FETCH_HEAD
Merge made by recursive.</code></pre>
