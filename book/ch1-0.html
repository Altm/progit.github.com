<h1>Chapter 1</h1><h1 id='introduction'>Introduction</h1>

<p>So you&#8217;re about to spend several hours of your life reading about Git. Let&#8217;s take a minute to explain what we have in store for you. In this first chapter, we&#8217;re going to cover Version Control Systems (VCS) and Git basics – no technical stuff, just what Git is, why it came about in a land full of VCSs, what sets it apart and why so many people are using it. Then we&#8217;re going to cover how to get it and set it up for the first time if you don&#8217;t already have it on your system.</p>

<p>In <strong>Chapter Two</strong> we will go over basic Git usage - how to use Git for the 80% of cases you will most often have to use it for. After this chapter, you should be able to clone a repository, see what&#8217;s going on, modify stuff and contribute changes. If the book spontaneously combusts at this point, you should already be pretty useful wielding Git in the meantime that it takes you to go pick up another copy.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter Three</strong> is about the branching model in Git, often described as Git&#8217;s killer feature. Here you will learn what truly sets Git apart from the pack, and when you are done you may likely feel the need to take a quiet moment and ponder how you lived life before Git branching was a part of it.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter Four</strong> will cover Git on the server. This chapter is for those of you who want to setup Git inside your organization or on your own personal server for collaboration. We will also cover various hosted options if you prefer to let someone else handle that for you.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter Five</strong> will go over in full detail various Distributed workflows and how to accomplish them with Git. When you are done with this chapter, you should be able to work expertly with multiple remote repositories, using Git over email and to deftly juggle numerous remote branches and contributed patches.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter Six</strong> is about advanced Git commands. Here you will learn things like binary searching to identify bugs, editing history, revision selection in detail and a lot more. This will round out your knowledge of Git so that you are truly a master.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter Seven</strong> is about configuring your custom Git environment. This includes setting up hook scripts to enforce or encourage customized policies and setting environment configuration settings so that you work how you want to. We will also cover building your own set of scripts to enforce a custom commiting policy.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter Eight</strong> deals with Git and other VCSs. This includes using Git in a Subversion world and converting projects from other VCSs to Git. A lot of organizations still use SVN and are not about to change, but you&#8217;ve learned the incredible power of Git – this chapter shows you how to cope. Git has top notch SVN tools, where you get all the local power of Git but can still submit to a SVN server.</p>

<p>Now that you know all about Git and can wield it with power and grace, you may want to read <strong>Chapter Nine</strong>, which delves into the murky yet beautiful depths of Git internals. Here we will show you details about how Git actually stores it&#8217;s objects, what the object model is, details about the packfile implementation, server protocols and more. Throughout the book we will refer to sections of this chapter if you feel like diving deep at that point, but if you are like me, you may actually want to read this section first. We leave that up to you.</p>
