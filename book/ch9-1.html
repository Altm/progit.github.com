<h2 id='plumbing_and_porcelain'>Plumbing and Porcelain</h2>

<p>DWP: When you say &#8216;will cover&#8217; below, that seems a bit odd for the last chapter!</p>

<p>In this book, we will cover how to use Git with about 40 or so verbs, such as &#8216;checkout&#8217;, &#8216;branch&#8217;, &#8216;remote&#8217; and so on. However, Git was actually initially a toolkit for an SCM rather than a full user friendly SCM, so it has a bunch of verbs that do real low-level work and were designed to be chained together UNIX style or called from scripts. These commands are generally referred to as &#8216;plumbing&#8217; commands, while the more user friendly commands are called &#8216;porcelain&#8217; commands.</p>

<p>DWP: I have forgotten what SCM stands for. I guess I might not be alone!</p>

<p>In the rest of this book, we deal almost exclusively with &#8216;porcelain&#8217; commands. However, in this chapter we will be dealing mostly with the lower level &#8216;plumbing&#8217; commands as they give us access to the underlying inner workings of Git and can help demonstrate how and why Git does what it does. These commands are not meant to be used manually on the command line, but to be used as building blocks for new tools and custom scripts.</p>
