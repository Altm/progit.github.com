title: Pro Git 1.6 Introduction Getting Help
---
<h2 id='getting_help'>Getting Help</h2>

<p>If you ever need help while using Git, there are three ways to get the manpage help for any of the Git commands.</p>

<pre><code>$ git help &lt;verb&gt;
$ git &lt;verb&gt; --help
$ man git-&lt;verb&gt;</code></pre>

<p>So, for example, you can get the manpage help for the &#8216;config&#8217; command by running</p>

<pre><code>$ git help config</code></pre>

<p>These commands are nice because you can access them anywhere, even offline.</p>

<p>If those manual pages and this book are not enough and you need in-person help, you can try the <code>#git</code> or <code>#github</code> channels on the Freenode IRC server (irc.freenode.net). They are regularly filled with hundreds of people who are all very knowledgable about Git and often very willing to help.</p><div id='nav'>
