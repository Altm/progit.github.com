title: Pro Git 9.5 Git Internals Commit Objects

<h2 id='commit_objects'>Commit Objects</h2>

<p>Now we have three trees that specify the different snapshots of our project that we wanted to track, but we have the same problem that we had earlier in that we have to remember all three SHA-1 values in order to recall the snapshots. Also, we don&#8217;t have any information about who saved the snapshots, when they saved them or why they saved them. This is the basic information that the &#8216;commit&#8217; object stores for us.</p>

<p>To create a commit object, we can call &#8216;commit-tree&#8217; and simply specify a tree SHA-1 and which commit objects, if any, directly preceeded it. We&#8217;ll start with the first tree that we wrote.</p>

<pre><code>$ echo &#39;first commit&#39; | git commit-tree d8329f
fdf4fc3344e67ab068f836878b6c4951e3b15f3d</code></pre>

<p>So, now we can look at our new commit object with <code>cat-file</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ git cat-file -p fdf4fc3
tree d8329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579
author Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@gmail.com&gt; 1243040974 -0700
committer Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@gmail.com&gt; 1243040974 -0700

first commit</code></pre>

<p>You can see that the format for a commit object is very simple. It just specifies the top level tree for the snapshot of the project at that point, then the author/committer information pulled from our <code>user.name</code> and <code>user.email</code> configuration settings, with the current timestamp then a blank line and then the commit message.</p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s write the other two commit objects, each referencing the commit that came directly before it.</p>

<pre><code>$ echo &#39;second commit&#39; | git commit-tree 0155eb -p fdf4fc3
cac0cab538b970a37ea1e769cbbde608743bc96d
$ echo &#39;third commit&#39;  | git commit-tree 3c4e9c -p cac0cab
1a410efbd13591db07496601ebc7a059dd55cfe9</code></pre>

<p>So now we have three commit objects, each pointing to one of the three snapshot trees we created. Oddly enough, we have a real Git history now that we can even view with the <code>git log</code> command if we run it on the last commit SHA-1.</p>

<pre><code>$ git log --stat 1a410e

<p>Amazing. We&#8217;ve now just done the low level operations to build up a Git history without using any of the nice frontends. This is essentially what Git is doing when you&#8217;re running the <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code> commands - storing blobs for the files that have changed, updating the index, writing out trees and writing commit objects that reference the top level trees and the commits that came immediately before them. Those are the three main Git objects - the &#8216;blob&#8217;, the &#8216;tree&#8217; and the &#8216;commit&#8217; and they are initially stored as simple seperate files in your &#8216;.git/objects&#8217; directory. Here are all the objects in our directory now, commented with what they actually store.</p>

<p>If you follow all the internal pointers, you get an object graph something like Fig 3.</p>
